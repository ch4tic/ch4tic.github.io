      <description>What programming languages do you know?
I&amp;rsquo;m programming in Python for over 3 years now, plan on learning GoLang.
What about cyber-security?
I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning about cybersecurity in 2019. and have been doing it ever since.
During that period I&amp;rsquo;ve conducted a few blackbox penetration tests for local IT companies which were all successful in securing their web applications.
Currently interning as a penetration tester and doing bug bounties in my free time.</description>
